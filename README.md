# SPAC Stars

This project is an android app for viewing information about Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, also known as SPACs.

Currently our app supports viewing listings of data about SPACs and searching for related posts about SPACs on certain social media.

# Running the Project

To run the app on a computer, Android Studio must first be downloaded from https://developer.android.com/studio and installed.

After setting up a virtual Android device from within Android Studio (or plugging in a real android device into the computer and installing the proper drivers), the app can be built and then run directly from Android Studio.

To run the app on an android phone, an APK file built automatically by the IDE can be found in app/build/outputs/apk/debug, named app-debug.apk.

The apk file can then be installed on an android phone. "Installation from Unknown Sources" must be allowed in your phone's settings.
